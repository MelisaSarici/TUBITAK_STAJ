TUBITAK MAM INTERNSHIP DIARY

Day 1-2
I have elucidated my interests on the power electronics engineering and control.
In the internship I met 3 engineers graduated from our university department.
On the common belief on the fact that high CGPA do not prefer power electronics,
I met Mr. Umut :D
Since I have an interest on power electronics control engineering focusing on
control optimization and design,we decided that I start on a project on designing
a solar panel charging control circuit starting with the background research on
gate drievers, buck and boost converters. I have been scrutinizing this subject on
Power Electornics Converters, Applications and Design Mohan's Book and Also
on the internet. I have downloaded 3 programs to familiarize with:Psim similar
to LTspice, Protheus for PCB design and Simplorer for simulation.
There is a book that I would like to mention:Grid Converters for Photovoltaic and Wind
Power Systems by Remus Teodorescu from Polytechnical University of Bucharest, marco Liserve
from Aalborg University, Denmark and Pedro Rodriguezfrom Catolonia Technical University.
The authors study in the field of designing power electronics and controllers of grid-connected contollers
on renewable energies. I liked the book very much, very encouraging indeed.
